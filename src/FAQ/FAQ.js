                        Slots will be allocated to waitlisted individuals on a first-come-first-serve basis. Do check your email regularly in case a slot has been freed up for you, and the workshop should also appear under "Confirmed Workshop"s on your profile. Should you receive a slot, remember to make payment at your profile within 48 hours to secure it!
