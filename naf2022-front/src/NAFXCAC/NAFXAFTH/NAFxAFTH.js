        Our primary aim is to help the less fortunate and do our part for the society. 
        In addition, we hope to promote the Arts through performances by our 23 CAC Member Clubs. 
        The AFTH Carnival is an annual event which NTU CAC Arts From The Heart holds to raise funds 
        for our beneficiary. The AFTH Carnival 2019 was successfully pulled off and $17,000 was raised 
        and donated to the Singapore Cancer Society (SCS). We are also honoured to be awarded Peopleâ€™s Choice 
        for the Social Impact Week 2020 exhibition. In view of the precautionary measures taken to tackle COVID-19, 
        we organised our first ever digital AFTH Carnival 2021: On Air! We are humbled to announce that about $7,500 
        has been raised for SCS and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) through our fundraising efforts in 
        2021. Through our efforts, we seek to not only promote the arts, but also to raise funds and increase awareness 
        for our beneficiaries. This year we are continuing our partnership with SAMH for the second consecutive year, 
        and will be having Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) on board with us as our second partner beneficiary.
