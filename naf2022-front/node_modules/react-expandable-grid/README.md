# react-expandable-grid

Image grid with an expanding detail view

An Easy to use react component to get your galleries and portfolios up and running quickly. When an user clicks on an image thumbnail, a preview window opens up showing a larger (or smaller, depending on the settings) image along with some textual information such as a title or a description.

It's always easier to use it than read about it... Check out the demo!


## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [karthicashokan.github.io/react-expandable-grid](http://karthicashokan.github.io/react-expandable-grid/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm run build
cd example
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-expandable-grid is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process.

You can also use the standalone build by including `src/react-expandable-grid.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-expandable-grid --save
```


## Usage


```
var ReactGridDetailExpansion = require('react-expandable-grid');

var data = [
{'img': '<url>', 'link': '<url>', 'title': '<text>', 'description': '<text>'},
{'img': '<url>', 'link': '<url>', 'title': '<text>', 'description': '<text>'}
]

var data_string = JSON.stringify(data)

<ReactGridDetailExpansion
                    gridData={data_string}
                    detailHeight={300}
                    ExpandedDetail_image_size={300}
                    cellSize={200}
                />
```

## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).
